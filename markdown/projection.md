# Stereoscopic projection
How we trick our brains into perceiving depth from two flat images

<!-- Note -->
OK so now that we know how "real" depth perception works, meaning how
our eyes signal to our brains that an object is at a greater or a
lesser distance from us, we can talk about how we can trick our brain
into seeing depth when objectively there is none, so taking two
two-dimensional images and making our brains conjure up a
three-dimensional image from that.

So for now, let's just assume this: we have two two-dimensional
images, and those correspond exactly to what your left eye, and what
your right eye would see. Here is an example of two such
images. (Don't worry for now about **how** we make that happen, we'll
get to that in a jiffy.) Then, we need to talk about **stereoscopic
projection:** making your left eye see *only* the left-eye image, and
making the right eye see *only* the right-eye image.


## The stereoscope
A low-tech stereoscopic viewing device

<!-- Note --> 
So let's start with something very low-tech: a stereoscopic viewer,
or, simply, a stereoscope. I happen to have one here; let me swiftly
explain how it works:

* You slide a print of your stereoscopic image in here,
* you close the device so the print is jammed in place and can't move
  about,
* then you bring the whole thing up to your face,
* and you look through the eyepieces.

And if you look at this little device from this angle, you'll notice
something important, namely this little black separator that ensures
that your left eye can't peek over at the right-eye image, and the
right eye can't catch a glimpse of the left-eye image.

And here are a couple of others that follow very much the same
principle, except that they are designed for larger images: here's one
for viewing larger prints, and here's one for viewing stereo images on
a large computer screen.

So these are all very simple and effective devices that have been in
use for stereoscopic viewing for a staggering nearly very-nearly-200
years!  (It was invented by a chap named Charles Wheatstone in 1832;
this device is a very modern interpretation using ABS plastic and
whatnot, but it's still the same principle. Even a modern set of
virtual reality goggles is the same principle, except you've got a
screen right in front of each of your eyes.)

But this kind of a device also has a flaw: it's not faring so greatly
on the social aspect of art. Sure, you can pass the stereoscope around
within a small group and appreciate the pictures together, but you'd
be hard pressed to actually do an exhibition with this, or anything
that you're showing to a larger crowd.

## Stereoscopic projectors
Using polarised light to create depth 

<!-- Note -->
*These notes were skipped over in the talk.*

So in comes the next step in the evolution of stereoscopic viewing:
the stereoscopic slide projector.

The principle is this: you load two slide projectors with a magazine
of slides each, one magazine holds the left-eye, one magazine holds
the right-eye images. You advance the slides in the projectors
simultaneously and you project the slides over one another, so they
fully overlap.

And then here's the clever twist: in front of each projector, you put
a filter. Namely, a *polarising* filter. Suppose, for the sake of
discussion, that you use a vertically polarising filter for your
"left" projector, and a horizontally polarising filter for your
"right" projector. Then, you distribute goggles to your audience that
have corresponding filter glasses: vertically polarized left,
horizontally polarised right. Then the filter will block all the light
coming from the right projector from entering your left eye, and block
all light coming from the left projector from entering your right
eye. Net result: your left eye only sees a left image, your right eye
only sees a right image, voila, 3D vision.

In *reality,* it's a wee bit more complicated, such as the fact that
when you do things this way your audience must keep their heads level
all the time: once they tilt their head, some of the left-eye image
light "leaks" into the right eye and vice versa, and the 3D effect
quickly collapses. And it's very strenuous to sit somewhere for an
hour and not be able to ever move your head. So you can address that
by using **circular** polarisation instead, for example: left eye --
clockwise-polarised, right eye -- anticlockwise-polarised. And then
it's also OK for your audience to tilt or move their heads a bit and
they'll retain the depth effect. That is the 3D projection technique
that most cinemas use.

## 3D TV
Stereoscopic projection for home theatres

<!-- Note -->
*These notes were skipped over in the talk.*

And then there's the at-home equivalent of that, which is 3D TV,
where you have alternating rows of pixels: one row of pixels emitting
light that's polarised one way, next row of pixels emitting light
polarised the other way, you wear goggles, and effectively each of
your eyes sees a picture at half the nominal vertical resolution, and
your brain again pieces those eye inputs together for a 3-dimensional
depth effect.

But of course, that too has a downside: it's pretty involved on the
technology and logistics side. You might need projectors, you might
need a silver screen (so as not to mess up the polarisation on
reflection), your audience needs goggles, the works. This is all very
much non-trivial.

So what if instead we could employ a technique that requires none of
that. No special projection equipment, no goggles, no nothing. Where
you could literally hang your stereophotography in a gallery, and
visitors could stroll through and look at your images and see them in
full depth. Or you could make a picture book. Or you could send 3D
images to a friend on your phone, and they wouldn't need an app to
view it.

And of course such a technique totally does exist, and we're going to
focus on it for the rest of this talk. It's called **freeviewing,**
and it comes in two flavours.
