## Freeviewing intro <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
So what if instead we could employ a technique that requires none of
that. No special projection equipment, no goggles, no nothing. Where
you could literally hang your stereophotography in a gallery, and
visitors could stroll through and look at your images and see them in
full depth. Or you could make a picture book. Or you could send 3D
images to a friend on your phone, and they wouldn't need an app to
view it.

And of course such a technique totally does exist, and we're going to
focus on it for the rest of this talk. It's called **freeviewing,**
and it comes in two flavours.


# Freeviewing
Perceiving depth in stereoscopic images without tools or gadgets

<!-- Note -->
So freeviewing in general means that we can take two stereoscopic
images and look at them using a certain technique that requires no
stereoscope, no projector, nothing. All we need is two functioning
eyes.

And for the two flavours of freeviewing, we've got one that's easy to
explain and understand, but difficult to do, and another that's a bit
more complex to comprehend, but somewhat easier to do -- at least for
most people. I'll start with the one that's easier to explain.


## Wall-eyed freeviewing
Looking *through* your image to perceive depth:  
easier to explain, harder to do

<!-- Note -->
This is called **wall-eyed stereoscopic freeviewing,** or parallel-view.

So what I have here is a print of a stereogram. It's the same image as
the one I showed you earlier with the stereoscope, just blown up a bit
because that makes things easier to demonstrate. Left-eye image on the
left, right-eye image on the right, just like with the one I put into
the stereoscope earlier. I'm going to put the image up here on my
little makeshift easel, and I'll use the two sticks here to illustrate
where I'm looking.

So, if I now just look at this print like I normally would, my
vergence and accommodation points both sit right on the surface of the
print. In other words, if I were to illustrate two straight lines from
both my eyes toward the point I'm looking at, it would look like
this. And that's what my eyes do naturally.

However, that's not to say that my eyes must converge on that spot, of
course. They can converge anywhere. Right now I'm looking at the
camera lens, now I'm looking at a tree trunk over there, now I'm
looking at the ground in front of me. So what I can do here is this:
instead of looking at the surface of the print, I'm looking at an
imaginary spot **behind** the print. And if I do this just right, if
you look at it from this angle, my left eye is looking at the left
image, and my right eye is looking at the right image. And what I
actually see now is **one** image that overlaps, is made from both
these source images, and, magically, has depth.

## Wall-eyed freeviewing example <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
Now you can try that with the image that's on your screen right
now. Now I don't know if you're watching this on a full size monitor,
or a laptop screen, or a big-screen TV, or your phone, so you may have
to play with the distance between your screen and eyes a bit. But the
principle is the same: you want to look **over** the top edge of your
screen, at a spot in the distance -- say, a picture on the wall --,
and then you want to try just coming down a little bit with your eyes,
and **not** change the spot that you're looking at in the process. And
then what'll happen is rather than seeing two images you'll see
*three:* a left one that's blurry, a right one that's blurry, and a
middle one, from the other two overlapping, that's sharp and that,
magically, has depth.

So, if you're watching this as a recording, now might be a good time
to pause the playback and give this a few tries, but if it doesn't
work for you don't fret!  Like I said, there's another method here
that we can use that is easier for most people -- including myself,
incidentally.


## Cross-eyed freeviewing
Crossing your eyes (slightly) to perceive depth from left-right
reversed images:  
sounds more complicated, but is easier to do in practice

<!-- Note -->
So with that let's go ahead to the other method, namely **cross-eyed
stereoscopic freeviewing,** or cross-view. Here's how this works.

Here is the cross-view version of the same picture. You might not
notice the difference straight away, but what's happened here is that
the two images are swapped. In other words, now it's the left-eye
image that's on the *right,* and the right-eye image that's on the
*left.*

So how do we view this? You're probably already guessing that if in a
wall-eyed image our vergence point is *behind* the print, in a
cross-eyed image it's *in front of* the print. So it looks like
this. And of course that means that my right eye is now looking at the
left half of the print, and my left eye is looking at the right
half. And the interesting bit about this is that that is **easier**
for a lot of people to voluntarily do -- and like I said, that very
much includes myself.

What you want to do now to see if cross-view works for you is this:
you look at this image and then deliberately cross your eyes (which
means you're totally overdoing it, but no matter), and then let your
eyes settle back toward normal. And chances are that the stimulus that
your brain produces when the images suddenly click into place and you
see depth is so strong that your eyes don't want to go back to where
they were.

So do try that with the image that's on your screen now, and do feel
free to pause the playback and try it a few times until you get the
hang of it. When you initially try this it may help if the image
you're looking at is rather large, relative to your total field of
vision, meaning you might want to get your face close to your laptop
screen or hold your phone up in front of your face. Once you get the
hang of it it won't matter anymore, and you'll be able to snap into
any cross-view image at will, no matter how small. But to get started
it's probably a good idea if you use a largeish image.

Now, chances are that you'll have a much easier time getting a depth
effect from cross-eyed freeviewing, because that works at any image
size. Wall-eyed freeviewing tends to work well only on relatively
small images, and once you go larger you'll probably really need a
stereoscope.

And of course I can't assume that you'll have a stereoscope at hand
right now as you're watching this talk. Which is why we'll default to
cross-eyed freeviewing from here on out.
